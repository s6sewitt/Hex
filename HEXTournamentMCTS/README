This project depends on ROOT. On the cip pool cluster ROOT is available through
module load root/6.14.04
to placate memory leak errors in address sanitizer also set form the command line
export ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0
both lines are included in file setup.sh. 

Instructions for participation in the Hex Tournament
You should start out by creating a framework for your own game engine
Execute from the command line:
source CreateEngine.sh YourEngineName

YourEngineName is the name of the engine, no spaces are allowed
The scrip creates a cxx and a header file within its own namespace
please keep everything you add within your own namespace.

Except for the files you created do not try to modify the provided files.
You are allowed to add more files and more classes if you like, if they are located in this directory. Also: do not modify the makefile.

Your engine inherits from IHexEngine which defines both the interface 
to the tournament program and serves as your base class.
HexPosition and IHexEngine contain many useful routines, please have a look, (especially HexPosition::Get/AddNeighbors and CheckForWin, GetDistance.

You yourself need to fill two functions in the derived class, GetNextMove and GetName
Please note that the base class stores always the last move in fLastMove.
and your engine will have no problems keeping track of the game.

You may ADD new classes, but please enclose them in your namespace

How to run your engine:

How to let the engine play against a human:

edit runHex.cxx 
-- include your header file
-- add your engine instead of the SimpleHexEngine
   use its full name: YourNAMESPACE::YourHexEngine

How to test the engine in tournament style, engine versus engine:
edit runTournament.cxx and tournament.h
-- make the same changes as for runHex.cxx

Each participant should equip their project with a jpg or bitmap image (square-size) that contains the logo of your HexEngine. This logo will be displayed when your engine plays matches in the tournament. 

Time limit:
The time limit per move is 1.0 seconds CPU time per move as specified in Hexboard::fTimeLimitPerMove

The tournament will be played with regular hex on board sizes 9 though 13.

Good luck!
